AI-Powered Decentralized Content Authenticity Platform
Overview
This project combines AI and blockchain to verify the authenticity of digital content (images, audio, text, and video). It detects deepfakes, manipulated content, and plagiarism using AI models, stores verification results on the blockchain for transparency, and allows users to mint verified content as NFTs. Built with React, Node.js, Ethereum, and IPFS, this platform promotes trust and transparency in digital content.
