# AI-Powered Decentralized Content Authenticity Platform

## Overview
This project combines AI and blockchain to verify the authenticity of digital content (images, audio, text, and video). It detects deepfakes, manipulated content, and plagiarism using AI models, stores verification results on the blockchain for transparency, and allows users to mint verified content as NFTs. Built with React, Node.js, Ethereum, and IPFS, this platform promotes trust and transparency in digital content.

## Key Features
- **AI-Powered Verification**: Detects deepfakes, manipulated images, and plagiarized text.
- **Blockchain Storage**: Stores content hashes and verification results on the blockchain.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Uses IPFS for secure and tamper-proof content storage.
- **Token Incentives**: Users earn tokens for submitting content or contributing to the platform.
- **NFT Integration**: Mint verified content as NFTs to prove authenticity.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity, Ethers.js
- **AI Models**: TensorFlow, Hugging Face
- **Storage**: IPFS, Pinata

## How It Works
1. Users upload content (images, audio, text, or video).
2. AI analyzes the content for authenticity.
3. Verification results and content hashes are stored on the blockchain.
4. Users can mint verified content as NFTs.

## Why This Project?
- Combats misinformation and fake content.
- Promotes trust and transparency in digital media.
- Scalable for use in journalism, social media, and legal evidence.
